# FeatureFlow Implementation

This repository implements a backend solution for dynamic feature flag management using FeatureFlow. It includes an API for managing feature flags, evaluating feature flag states based on users' attributes, and supporting environment-specific configurations. The project also includes a simple front-end for managing feature flags.

## Features
- Manage multiple feature flags with on/off or variant values (e.g., A/B tests).
- Evaluate feature flags dynamically for specific users based on user attributes (e.g., `userID`, `subscriptionType`, `region`).
- Manage feature flags for different environments (`development`, `staging`, `production`).
- Toggle feature flags and track changes with audit logging.
- Use MongoDB to store feature flags and user configurations.
- Web interface to manage feature flags and toggle them.
